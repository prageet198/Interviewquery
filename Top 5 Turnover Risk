Question:-
Let’s say you’re working in HR at a major tech company, and they ask you to find employees with a high probability of leaving the company. 
They tell you these employees perform well but have the lowest pay.

Given two tables, employees and projects, find the five lowest-paid employees who have completed at least three projects.

Note: We consider projects to be completed when they have an end date, which is the same as saying their End_dt is not NULL.

Solution:-
SELECT projects.employee_id
FROM projects INNER JOIN employees 
ON projects.employee_id=employees.id
WHERE Start_dt IS NOT NULL AND End_dt IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(project_id)>=3
ORDER BY salary
LIMIT 5
