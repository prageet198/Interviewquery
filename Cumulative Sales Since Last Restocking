Question:-
As an accountant for a local grocery store, you have been tasked with calculating the daily sales of each product since their last restocking.

You have been provided with three tables: products, sales, and restocking. The products table contains information about each product, 
the sales table records the sales transactions, and the restocking table tracks the restocking events.

Write a query to retrieve the running total of sales for each product since its last restocking event.

Notes: The sales_since_last_restock column represents the cumulative sales of the product for each day since its 
last restocking event. Order the result set by product_id.

Solution:-
WITH restockingCalculation AS (
    SELECT product_id,
    MAx(restock_date) AS currentRestockDate
    FROM restocking
    GROUP BY 1
),
combineData AS (
SELECT sales.product_id,
sales.date AS salesDate,
sales.sold_count,
restockingCalculation.currentRestockDate AS restockDate,
CASE WHEN (sales.date>=restockingCalculation.currentRestockDate) 
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
FROM sales INNER JOIN restockingCalculation
ON sales.product_id=restockingCalculation.product_id
)
SELECT products.product_name,
salesDate AS date,
SUM(sold_count) OVER(PARTITION BY products.product_name ORDER BY salesDate)
AS sales_since_last_restock
FROM combineData INNER JOIN products
ON combineData.product_id=products.product_id
WHERE flag='1'
