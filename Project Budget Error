Question:-
We’re given two tables. One is named projects and the other maps employees to the projects they’re working on. 

We want to select the five most expensive projects by budget to employee count ratio. 
But let’s say that we’ve found a bug where there exist duplicate rows in the employee_projects table.

Write a query to account for the error and select the top five most expensive projects by budget to employee count ratio.

Solution-1:-
WITH projectEmp AS (
    SELECT project_id, employee_id
        FROM employee_projects
        GROUP BY 1,2
),
empCountPerProject AS (
SELECT project_id, COUNT(*) AS totalEmp
FROM projectEmp
GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT projects.title,
projects.budget/totalEmp AS budget_per_employee
FROM empCountPerProject INNER JOIN projects
ON empCountPerProject.project_id=projects.id
ORDER BY budget_per_employee DESC
LIMIT 5;

Solution-2:-
SELECT ROUND((projects.budget / COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id)), 2) AS budget_per_employee,
       projects.title
FROM employee_projects
INNER JOIN projects ON employee_projects.project_id = projects.id
GROUP BY projects.title, projects.budget
ORDER BY budget_per_employee DESC
LIMIT 5;
