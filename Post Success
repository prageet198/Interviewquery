Question:-Consider the events table which contains information about the phases of writing a new social media post.

The action column can have values post_enter, post_submit, or post_canceled for when a user starts to write (post_enter), ends up 
canceling their post (post_cancel), or posts it (post_submit).

Write a query to get the post success rate for each day in the month of January 2020.

You can assume that a single user may only make one post per day.

Solution:-
WITH overallUsers AS(
SELECT
DATE(created_at) AS userDate,
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS totalUsers
FROM events 
WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
),
overallSubmits AS (
SELECT 
DATE(created_at) AS submitDate,
COUNT(id) AS totalSubmited
FROM events
WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
AND action='post_submit'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
)

SELECT overallUsers.userDate AS dt,
CASE WHEN overallSubmits.submitDate IS NULL THEN 0
ELSE
(totalSubmited/totalUsers) END AS post_success_rate
FROM overallUsers LEFT JOIN overallSubmits
ON overallUsers.userDate=overallSubmits.submitDate

Solution-2:-
WITH stats AS ( 
    SELECT user_id, created_at, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = "post_enter" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS started, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = "post_submit" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS posted
    FROM events
    where EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at)  = "202001" 
    GROUP BY user_id, created_at

)
SELECT Date(created_at) as dt, 
(SUM(posted) / SUM(started)) AS post_success_rate 
FROM stats 
GROUP BY created_at
