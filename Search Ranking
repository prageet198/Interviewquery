each position the search result came in, and the rating column represents the human rating of the result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

Please round your answer to two decimal points.

Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (

rating,
CASE WHEN rating IN (1,2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
FROM search_results
ORDER BY query
),
filterData AS(

FROM calculation
GROUP BY query
HAVING COUNT(*)=SUM(flag)
),
totalLessRatingUsers AS(
