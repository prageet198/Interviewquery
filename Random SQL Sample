Question:-
Letâ€™s say we have a table with an id and name fields. The table holds over 100 million rows and we want to sample a 
random row in the table without throttling the database.

Write a query to randomly sample a row from this table.

Solution:-
SELECT r1.id, r1.name
FROM big_table AS r1 
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT CEIL(RAND() * (
        SELECT MAX(id)
        FROM big_table)
    ) AS id
) AS r2
    ON r1.id >= r2.id
ORDER BY r1.id ASC
LIMIT 1
