Question:-
Given a table of job postings, write a query to retrieve the number of users that have posted each job only once and 
the number of users that have posted at least one job multiple times.

Each user has at least one job posting. Thus the sum of single_post and multiple_posts should equal the total number of distinct user_idâ€™s.

Solution:-
WITH totalUniqueJobs AS(
SELECT user_id,
COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS totalJobs
FROM job_postings 
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id
),
totalJobPostings AS (
SELECT user_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalJobPost
FROM job_postings 
GROUP BY user_id
),
calculation AS (
SELECT totalUniqueJobs.user_id,
totalJobs,
totalJobPost,
CASE WHEN totalJobs=totalJobPost THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
FROM totalUniqueJobs INNER JOIN totalJobPostings
ON totalUniqueJobs.user_id=totalJobPostings.user_id
),
singlePost AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS single_post
FROM calculation WHERE flag='1'
),
multiplePost AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS multiple_posts
FROM calculation WHERE flag='0'
)
SELECT * FROM singlePost,multiplePost

Solution-2:-
WITH user_job AS (

SELECT user_id
       , COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS n_jobs
       , COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS n_posts
    FROM job_postings
    GROUP BY 1

    )
    
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN n_jobs = n_posts THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 
single_post
,SUM(CASE WHEN n_jobs != n_posts THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 
multiple_posts
FROM user_job
