Question:-
Letâ€™s say you run a wine house. You have detailed information about the chemical composition of wines in a wines table.

One day, a customer comes asking specifically for a wine that has

    Greater or equal to than 13% alcohol content
    Ash content less than 2.4
    A color intensity less than 3

Write a query to find the ids of suitable wines for this customer.

Note: All percentages are reported with two numbers before the decimal point; for example, 13.55% is represented as 13.55 instead of 0.1355.

Example:

Input:
wines table
Column	Type
id	INTEGER
alcohol	FLOAT
malic_acid	FLOAT
ash	FLOAT
alcalinity_of_ash	FLOAT
magnesium	INTEGER
total_phenols	FLOAT
flavanoids	FLOAT
nonflavanoid_phenols	FLOAT
proanthocyanins	FLOAT
color_intensity	FLOAT
hue	FLOAT
od280_or_od315_of_diluted_wines	FLOAT
proline	INTEGER

Solution:-
SELECT id
FROM wines 
WHERE alcohol>=13 AND ash<2.4 AND color_intensity<3
