Question:-
Given a table with event logs, find the percentage of users that had at least one seven-day streak of visiting the same URL.

Note: Round the results to 2 decimal places. For example, if the result is 35.67% return 0.35.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT user_id,
created_at,
url,
LAG(url,1,url) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id) AS prevUrl,
DATEDIFF(created_at, LAG(created_at,1,created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id))
AS day_diff
FROM events
),
grouped AS (
SELECT *,
SUM(CASE WHEN day_diff > 1 THEN 1 
WHEN day_diff IN (0,1) AND (url=prevUrl) THEN 0 END) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS group_id
FROM combineData
),
totalValues AS (
SELECT user_id,
group_id,
COUNT(*) AS toatlStreak
 FROM grouped
 GROUP BY user_id,group_id
 HAVING(COUNT(*))>=7
),
totalStreakUsers AS(
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tt FROM totalValues
),
totalUsers AS(
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS allUsers FROM events
)

SELECT CASE WHEN tt=0 THEN 0
ELSE
ROUND((tt/allUsers),2) END AS percent_of_users
FROM totalUsers,totalStreakUsers
