Question:-
Letâ€™s say we are given a table user_logins.

Using this table, calculate how many users logged in an identical number of times on January 1st, 2022.

For example, it may be the case that on that date three users logged in seven times, four users logged in five times, two users logged in ten times, etc.

Solution:-
WITH overalldata AS (
    SELECT COUNT(user_id) AS number_of_logins
FROM user_logins
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM login_date)='2022' 
AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM login_date)='01'
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM login_date)='01'
GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT number_of_logins, COUNT(*) AS number_of_users
FROM overalldata
GROUP BY number_of_logins
