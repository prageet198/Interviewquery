Question:-
You’re given three tables.

An ads table holds an ID and the advertisement name like “Labor day shirts sale”. The feed_comments table holds the comments on ads 
by different users that occur in the regular feed. The moments_comments table holds the comments on ads by different users in the moments section.

Write a query to get the percentage of comments, by ad, that occurs in the feed versus mentions sections of the app.

Solution:-
WITH feedTotal AS (
SELECT ad_id,
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS totalFeedCmt
FROM feed_comments
GROUP BY ad_id
),
momentsTotal AS (
    SELECT ad_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS totalMomentsCmt
    FROM moments_comments
    GROUP BY ad_id
),
calculation AS (
SELECT feedTotal.ad_id,
 (totalfeedcmt::float/(totalFeedCmt+totalMomentsCmt)) AS percentage_feed,
 (totalMomentsCmt::float/(totalFeedCmt+totalMomentsCmt)) AS percentage_moments
FROM feedTotal INNER JOIN momentsTotal
ON feedTotal.ad_id=momentsTotal.ad_id
)

SELECT ads.name,
percentage_feed,
percentage_moments
FROM calculation INNER JOIN ads 
ON calculation.ad_id=ads.id
