Question:-
Given a table called user_experiences, write a query to determine the percentage of users that held the title of “Data Analyst” 
immediately before holding the title “Data Scientist”.

Immediate is defined as the user holding no other titles between the “Data Analyst” and “Data Scientist” roles.

Solution-1:-
WITH totalUsers AS(
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS tc
FROM user_experiences
),
onlyDataAnalyst AS(
    SELECT user_id,
     position_name,
     LAG (position_name,1,position_name) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY start_date) AS prevPost
    FROM user_experiences
),
studentCount AS(
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) As totalStudent FROM onlyDataAnalyst
WHERE prevpost='Data Analyst' AND position_name='Data Scientist'
)
SELECT (totalStudent::float/tc) AS percentage
FROM studentCount,totalUsers

Solution-2:-
WITH added_previous_role AS (
  SELECT user_id, position_name,
  LAG (position_name) 
  OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) 
  AS previous_role
  FROM user_experiences
),
 
experienced_subset AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM added_previous_role
  WHERE position_name = 'Data Scientist' 
    AND previous_role = 'Data Analyst'
)
 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT experienced_subset.user_id)/
     COUNT(DISTINCT user_experiences.user_id) 
AS percentage
FROM user_experiences
LEFT JOIN experienced_subset 
    ON user_experiences.user_id = experienced_subset.user_id
