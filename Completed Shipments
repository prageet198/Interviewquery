Question:-
Let’s say that you’re a data scientist working on a distribution team at Amazon.

Create a report displaying which shipments were delivered to customers during their membership period.

If the transaction is shipped during the membership period, column is_member should have the value Y. If not, the column should have the value N.

Hint: You may assume that customer_id is unique and that shipments are made only to registered customers.

Solution:-
SELECT shipments.shipment_id,
shipments.ship_date,
shipments.customer_id AS customer_id,
CASE WHEN shipments.ship_date BETWEEN customers.membership_start_date
AND customers.membership_end_date THEN 'Y'
ELSE 'N' END AS is_memeber,
shipments.quantity
FROM customers INNER JOIN shipments 
ON customers.customer_id=shipments.customer_id
