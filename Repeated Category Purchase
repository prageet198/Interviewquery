Question:-
You’re analyzing a user’s purchases for a retail business.

Each product belongs to a category. Your task is to identify which purchases represent the first time the user has bought a product from its own category 
and which purchases represent repeat purchases within the product category.

The id in the purchases table represents the purchase order (rows with a lower id are earlier purchases).

Your code should output a table that includes every purchase the user has made. Additionally, the table should include a boolean column 
with a value of 1 if the user has previously purchased a product from its category and 0 if it’s their first time buying a product from that category.

Note: Sort the results by the time purchased, in ascending order.

Solution:-
WITH allData AS(
SELECT id, product_name, product_category,
LAG(product_category,1,0) OVER (PARTITION BY product_category ORDER BY id) AS prevCat
FROM purchases 
)
SELECT product_name,
CASE WHEN product_category=prevCat THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS category_previously_purchased
FROM allData
ORDER BY id
