Question:-
Write a query that creates an attribution rule for each user. If the user visited Facebook or Google at least once then the attribution is labeled as “paid.” 
Otherwise, the attribution is labeled as “organic.”

Solution-1:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT user_sessions.session_id,
user_sessions.user_id,
attribution.channel,
CASE WHEN channel='facebook' OR channel='google' THEN 1 END AS flag
FROM user_sessions INNER JOIN attribution 
ON user_sessions.session_id=attribution .session_id
),
paidOnly AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(user_id),
"paid" AS attribute
FROM combineData WHERE flag='1'
),
notPaid AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(user_id),
"organic" AS attribute
FROM combineData WHERE flag IS NULL
AND user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM paidOnly)
)
SELECT * FROM paidOnly
UNION
SELECT * FROM notPaid

Solution-2:-
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN (channel = 'Facebook' OR channel = 'Google') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS paid_count
    FROM user_sessions
        JOIN attribution ON 
            user_sessions.session_id = attribution.session_id
    GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT
    user_id,
    CASE WHEN paid_count >=1 THEN 'paid' ELSE 'organic' END AS attribute
FROM cte
