Question:-
Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold, or in other words, the number of users who bought additional products after their first purchase.

Note: If the customer purchased two things on the same day, that does not count as an upsell, as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.

Solution:-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS num_of_upsold_customers
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, created_at
FROM transactions 
WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id
FROM transactions
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>1)
GROUP BY 1,2
HAVING COUNT(*)=1
)AS A
ORDER BY 1
