Question:-
You’re given two tables, users and events. The events table holds values of all of the user events in the action column (‘like’, ‘comment’, or ‘post’).

Write a query to get the percentage of users that have never liked or commented. Round to two decimal places.

Solution:-

WITH totalUser AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalRegisteredUsers
    FROM users
),
neverUsers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalNeverUsers
    FROM users
    WHERE id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT user_id
        FROM events
        WHERE action IN ('like', 'comment')
    )
)
SELECT ROUND((neverUsers.totalNeverUsers::numeric) / totalUser.totalRegisteredUsers,2) AS percent_never
FROM totalUser, neverUsers;
