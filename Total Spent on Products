Question:-
Let’s say you work at Costco. Costco has a database with two tables. The first is users composed of user information, 
including their registration date, and the second is purchases that has the entire item purchase history (if any) for those users.

Write a query to get the total amount spent on each item in the ‘purchases’ table by users that registered in 2022.

Solution:-
SELECT item, SUM(price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM users INNER JOIN purchases ON users.user_id=CAST(purchases.user_id AS int)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM registration_date)='2022'
GROUP BY item
