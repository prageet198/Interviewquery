Question:-
The sales department is conducting a performance review and is interested in trends in product sales. They have decided to use a 
weighted moving average as part of their analysis.

Write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day weighted moving average of sales for each product. Use the weights 0.5 for the current day, 0.3 
for the previous day, and 0.2 for the day before that.

Note: Only output the weighted moving average for dates that have two or more preceding dates. You may assume that the table doesnâ€™t skip dates.

Solution:-
WITH overallData AS(
SELECT date,
product_id,
LAG(sales_volume, 2) OVER ( PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date) AS sales_volume_3_days_ago,
LAG(sales_volume, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date) AS sales_volume_2_days_ago,
sales_volume AS sales_volume_today
FROM sales
)
SELECT date,
product_id,
(sales_volume_today*0.5) + (sales_volume_2_days_ago*0.3) + (sales_volume_3_days_ago*0.2) AS weighted_avg_sales
FROM overallData
WHERE sales_volume_3_days_ago IS NOT NULL AND sales_volume_2_days_ago IS NOT NULL
