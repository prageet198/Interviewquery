Question:-
Given a table with event logs, find the top five users with the longest continuous streak of visiting the platform.

Note: A continuous streak counts if the user visits the platform at least once per day on consecutive days.

Solution:-
WITH uniqueData AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        DATE(created_at) AS visitDate
    FROM 
        events 
    GROUP BY 
        user_id, 
        DATE(created_at)
),
ranked_log AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        visitDate,
        DATEDIFF(visitDate, LAG(visitDate, 1, visitDate) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY visitDate)) AS day_diff
    FROM 
        uniqueData
),
grouped AS (
    SELECT 
    *,
     SUM(CASE WHEN day_diff > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY visitDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS group_id
FROM ranked_log
),
calculation AS (
SELECT user_id,
group_id,
COUNT(*) AS streak_length
FROM grouped
GROUP BY user_id, group_id
)
SELECT MAX(streak_length) AS streak_length,
user_id
FROM calculation
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY 1 DESC,2
LIMIT 5
