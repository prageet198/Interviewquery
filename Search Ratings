Question:-
You’re given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. The query column is the search term, the position column represents each position the search result came in, and the rating column represents the human rating of the search result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

Example:

Input:

search_results table
Column 	Type
query 	VARCHAR
result_id 	INTEGER
position 	INTEGER
rating 	INTEGER

You want to be able to compute a metric that measures the precision of the ranking system based on position. For example, if the results for dog and cat are…
query 	result_id 	position 	rating 	notes
dog 	1000 	1 	2 	picture of hotdog
dog 	998 	2 	4 	dog walking
dog 	342 	3 	1 	zebra
cat 	123 	1 	4 	picture of cat
cat 	435 	2 	2 	cat memes
cat 	545 	3 	1 	pizza shops

…we would rank ‘cat’ as having a better search result ranking precision than ‘dog’ based on the correct sorting by rating.

Write a query to create a metric that can validate and rank the queries by their search result precision. Round the metric (avg_rating column) to 2 decimal places.

Solution:-
SELECT
    query,
    ROUND(AVG((1/position) * rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM
    search_results
GROUP BY
    query
ORDER BY
    avg_rating DESC;
