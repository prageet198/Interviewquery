Question:-
Over budget on a project is defined when the salaries, prorated to the day, exceed the budget of the project.

For example, if Alice and Bob both combined income make 200K and work on a project of a budget of 50K that takes half a year, then the project 
is over budget given 0.5 * 200K = 100K > 50K.

Write a query to forecast the budget for all projects and return a label of "overbudget" if it is over budget and "within budget" otherwise.

Note: Assume that employees only work on one project at a time.

Solution:-
WITH projectTotalEmpSal AS(
SELECT 
SUM(salary) AS totalEmpProjectSalary,
employee_projects.project_id
from employees INNER JOIN employee_projects 
ON employees.id=employee_projects.employee_id
GROUP BY employee_projects.project_id
),
projectDetails AS (
SELECT id,
title,
budget,
CAST(DATE_PART('day', end_date - start_date) AS INTEGER) AS totalDays
FROM projects
),
calculation AS (
SELECT projectDetails.id,
projectDetails.title,
projectDetails.budget,
projectDetails.totalDays,
totalEmpProjectSalary,
((totaldays::numeric)/365)*totalempprojectsalary AS calculatedBudget
FROM projectTotalEmpSal INNER JOIN projectDetails
ON projectTotalEmpSal.project_id=projectDetails.id
)

SELECT title,
CASE WHEN budget>=calculatedBudget THEN 'within budget'
ELSE 'overbudget' END AS project_forecast
FROM calculation
