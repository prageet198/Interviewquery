Question:-
Weâ€™re given two tables. friend_requests holds all the friend requests made and friend_accepts is all of the acceptances.

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of friend requests.

Note: Round results to 4 decimal places.

Solution-1:-
SELECT  CAST(COUNT(b.acceptor_id)/ COUNT(a.requester_id) AS DECIMAL(5,4)) AS acceptance_rate 
FROM friend_requests a
LEFT JOIN friend_accepts b 
ON a.requester_id = b.requester_id AND a.requested_id = b.acceptor_id;
