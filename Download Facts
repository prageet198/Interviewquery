Question:-
Given two tables: accounts, and downloads, find the average number of downloads for free vs paying accounts, broken down by day.

Solution:-
SELECT download_date, 
CASE WHEN paying_customer='false' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS paying_customer, 
AVG(downloads) AS average_downloads
FROM accounts INNER JOIN downloads 
ON accounts.account_id=downloads.account_id
GROUP BY download_date, paying_customer
