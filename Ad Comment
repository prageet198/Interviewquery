Question:-
You’re given three tables.

An ads table holds an ID and the advertisement name like “Labor day shirts sale”. The feed_comments table holds the comments on ads by different 
users that occur in the regular feed. The moments_comments table holds the comments on ads by different users in the moments section.

Write a query to get the percentage of comments, by ad, that occurs in the feed versus mentions sections of the app.

Solution:-
WITH feedCmt AS (
SELECT ad_id,
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS totalFeedComment
FROM feed_comments
GROUP BY ad_id
),
momentsCmt AS (
    SELECT ad_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS totalMomentComment
    FROM moments_comments
    GROUP BY ad_id
)
SELECT ads.name,
(totalFeedComment)/(totalFeedComment+totalMomentComment) AS percentage_feed,
(totalMomentComment)/(totalFeedComment+totalMomentComment)AS percentage_moments
FROM ads LEFT JOIN momentsCmt
ON ads.id=momentsCmt.ad_id
LEFT JOIN feedCmt
ON ads.id=feedCmt.ad_id
