Question:-
A social media company re-designed its UI to include notifications to users when they receive friend requests.

Evaluate if this change increased the friend request acceptance rate. Find the acceptance rate for friend requests 
sent in the four weeks prior to (and including) July 2nd, 2022.

Note: The acceptance rate is the percentage of sent requests that were accepted.*

Assume that nobody sends or accepts the same request twice. We will consider two friend requests to be duplicates when their sender and receiver are the same.

Solution:-
WITH totalRequestSend AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalRequest
FROM friend_requests
WHERE DATE(sent_at) BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2022-07-02', INTERVAL 4 WEEK) AND '2022-07-02'
),
totalAcceptedRequest AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalAccepted
FROM friend_requests INNER JOIN requests_accepted
ON friend_requests.requester_id=requests_accepted.requester_id
AND friend_requests.receiver_id=requests_accepted.accepter_id
WHERE DATE(sent_at) BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2022-07-02', INTERVAL 4 WEEK) AND '2022-07-02'
)

SELECT COALESCE((totalAccepted/totalRequest),1) AS acceptance_rate
FROM totalRequestSend INNER JOIN totalAcceptedRequest
ON 1=1
