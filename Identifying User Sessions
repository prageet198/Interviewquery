Question:-
Suppose you have an events table that tracks user activities on a website. Write a query to identify and label each event with a session number. 
All events in the same session should be labeled with the same session number.

Note: A session is defined as a series of consecutive events for a user that are within 60 minutes of each other.

i.e. If a user has a series of events at 00:01:00, 00:30:00, 01:01:00, this would be considered 1 session but a series 
of events at 00:01:00, 00:30:00, 01:31:00 would be 2 sessions.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
    SELECT *,
           LAG(created_at, 1, created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS previous_event_time
    FROM events
),
calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        created_at,
        user_id,
        event,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, previous_event_time, created_at) AS duration_minutes,
        CASE
            WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, previous_event_time, created_at) > 60 OR previous_event_time = created_at THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS new_session_flag
    FROM combineData
)
SELECT 
    created_at,
    user_id,
    event,
    SUM(new_session_flag) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS session_id
FROM calculation
ORDER BY user_id, created_at;
