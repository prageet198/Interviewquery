Question:-A marketing team is reviewing their past email campaigns to measure the effectiveness of each campaign. 
Theyâ€™ve collected data on the number of users who opened each email and clicked on a link.

Write a SQL query to calculate the weighted average score for each campaign, where the weight of the open rate is 0.3 and the weight of the click rate is 0.7.

Note: The weighted average should be rounded to two decimal places.

Solution:-
SELECT campaign_name,
ROUND(((num_opens/num_users)*0.3) + ((num_clicks/num_users)*0.7),2) AS weighted_avg
FROM email_campaigns;
