Given a table of song_plays and a table of users, write a query to extract the earliest date each user played their third unique song.

Note: If a user has listened to less than three unique songs, display their name but with a NULL date and song name

Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
SELECT user_id,
song_name,
MIN(date_played) AS playedDate,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id) AS rn
FROM song_plays
GROUP BY user_id, song_name
),
filterData AS (
SELECT user_id,
song_name,
playedDate AS date_played
FROM calculation
WHERE rn='3'
)
SELECT users.name,
song_name,
date_played
FROM users LEFT JOIN filterData
ON users.id=filterData.user_id
