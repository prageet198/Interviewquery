Question:-
Let’s say you work for a small airline. You’re given three tables: flights, planes, and flight_purchases.

Write a query to find the number of unpurchased seats for each flight.

For the purposes of this question, assume that there will be no entries in the flight_purchases table for flights or seats that do not exist.

Solution:-
WITH totalPurchased AS (
SELECT flight_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalPurchasedSeats
FROM flight_purchases
GROUP BY flight_id
)

SELECT flights.id AS flight_id,
(number_of_seats-totalPurchasedSeats) AS free_seats
FROM totalPurchased INNER JOIN flights
ON totalPurchased.flight_id=flights.id
INNER JOIN planes
ON planes.id=flights .plane_id
