Question:-
Given a table of account statuses, write a query to get the percentage of accounts that were active on December 31st, 2019, 
and closed on January 1st, 2020, over the total number of accounts that were active on December 31st. 
Each account has only one daily record indicating its status at the end of the day.

Solution:-
WITH decMonth AS (
SELECT account_id,
status AS decStatus
FROM account_status
WHERE date='2019-12-31' AND status='open'
),
janMonth AS (
SELECT account_id,
status AS janStatus
FROM account_status
WHERE date='2020-01-01'
),
calculation AS (
SELECT 
SUM(CASE WHEN decstatus='open' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS decTotal,
SUM(CASE WHEN (decstatus='open' AND janstatus='closed') 
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS janTotal
FROM decMonth INNER JOIN janMonth
ON decMonth.account_id=janMonth.account_id
)
SELECT (janTotal::float/decTotal) AS percentage_closed
FROM calculation
