Question:-
Suppose your company needs to cut costs due to an economic downturn. During a coffee break, you hear a rumor that a lot of money goes to 
employees who don’t do their work, and you decide to find out if the rumor is true.

Given two tables: employees and projects, find the sum of the salaries of all the employees who didn’t complete any of their projects.

Clarification:

We will consider a project unfinished if it has no end date (its End_dt is NULL).

Given this, we’ll say an employee didn’t finish any of their projects when:

    They were assigned at least one project.
    None of their projects have an End_dt.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT employees.id AS empId,
salary,
COUNT(*) AS totalProjects,
SUM(CASE WHEN End_dt IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS totalNoProject
FROM employees INNER JOIN projects
ON employees.id=projects.employee_id
GROUP BY 1,2
)
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_slack_salary
FROM combineData
WHERE totalNoProject=totalProjects
