Question:-
Write a query to determine the top 5 actions performed during the month of November 2020, for actions performed on an Apple platform (iPhone, iPad).

The events table tracks every time a user performs a certain action (like post_enter, etc.) on a platform (android, web, etc.).

The output should include the action performed and itâ€™s rank in ascending order. If two actions are performed equally, they should have the same rank. 

Solution:-
WITH allData AS (
SELECT action, COUNT(*) AS totalActions
FROM events
WHERE platform IN ('iphone', 'ipad') 
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)='2020'
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at)='11'
GROUP BY action
)
SELECT action, 
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY totalActions DESC) AS ranks
FROM allData
LIMIT 5
