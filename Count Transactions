Question:-
Letâ€™s say we have an annual_payments table. Answer the following three questions via SQL queries and output them as a table with the answers to each question.

   1.How many total transactions are in this table?
   2.How many different users made transactions?
   3.How many transactions listed as "paid" have an amount greater or equal to 100?
   4.Which product made the highest revenue? (use only transactions with a "paid" status)
Solution:-
SELECT 1 AS question_id, COUNT(*) AS answer
FROM annual_payments 
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS question_id, COUNT(DISTINCT (user_id)) AS totalTransaction
FROM annual_payments
UNION ALL
SELECT 3 AS question_id, COUNT(*) AS totalTransaction
FROM annual_payments 
WHERE status='paid' AND amount>=100
UNION ALL
(SELECT 4 AS question_id ,product FROM (SELECT SUM(amount) AS amt, product
FROM annual_payments 
WHERE status='paid'
GROUP BY product) AS A ORDER BY amt DESC LIMIT 1)
