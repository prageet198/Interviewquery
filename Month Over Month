Question:-
Given a table of transactions and products, write a function to get the month_over_month change in revenue for the year 2019. 
Make sure to round month_over_month to 2 decimal places.

Solution:-
WITH initialData AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) AS transMonth,
        (quantity * price) AS totalPrice
    FROM 
        transactions
        INNER JOIN products ON transactions.product_id = products.id
    WHERE 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = '2019'
),
calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        transMonth,
        SUM(totalPrice) AS totalMonthly
    FROM 
        initialData
    GROUP BY 
        transMonth
),
monthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT 
        transMonth,
        totalMonthly,
        LAG(totalMonthly, 1) OVER (ORDER BY transMonth) AS previousMonth
    FROM 
        calculation
),
overallCalculation AS (
SELECT 
    transMonth,
    CASE 
        WHEN previousMonth IS NULL THEN NULL
        ELSE (totalMonthly - previousMonth) / previousMonth
    END AS month_over_month_growth
FROM 
    monthlyRevenue
)
SELECT transMonth AS month,
ROUND(month_over_month_growth::numeric,2) AS month_over_month
FROM overallCalculation
