Question:-
We’re given two tables. One is named projects and the other maps employees to the projects they’re working on.

Write a query to get the top five most expensive projects by budget to employee count ratio.

Note: Exclude projects with 0 employees. Assume each employee works on only one project.

Solution:-
SELECT projects.title,
(projects.budget/COUNT(employee_projects.employee_id)) AS
budget_per_employee
FROM projects INNER JOIN employee_projects 
ON projects.id=employee_projects.project_id
GROUP BY projects.title,projects.budget
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
