Note: Return the percentage of transactions ordered to their home address as home_address_percent.

Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
    SELECT COUNT(transactions.id) AS tid,
SUM(CASE WHEN transactions.shipping_address=users.address
THEN 1 END) AS isMAtched
FROM transactions INNER JOIN users
ON transactions.user_id=users.id
)

SELECT (isMAtched/tid) AS home_address_percent
FROM calculation
