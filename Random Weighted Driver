Question:-
Letâ€™s say we want to improve the matching algorithm for drivers and riders for Uber. The engineering team has added a new column 
to the drivers table called weighting. It contains a weighted value, which they hope will lead to better matching.

Given this table of drivers, write a query to perform a weighted random selection of a driver based on the driver weight.

Solution:-
select q2.id from
(
  select q1.id, q1.scaled_weights, sum(q1.scaled_weights) over (order by q1.id ) cumulative_th
  from
     (
      select id ,  weighting/sum(weighting) over() as scaled_weights from drivers
     ) q1
) q2
where cumulative_th > rand()
order by id
limit 1;
