Question:-
Letâ€™s say you work at Allstate. Allstate is running N online ads right now. The table ads contains all those ads, ranked by popularity via 
the id column (e.g., the entry with id = 1 is the most popular, etc.).

Create a subquery or common table expression named top_ads containing the top 3 ads (by popularity) and return the number of rows that 
would result from the following operations

    ads INNER JOIN top_ads
    ads LEFT JOIN top_ads
    ads RIGHT JOIN top_ads
    ads CROSS JOIN top_ads

Note: Please make the join_type column in your output have the values inner_join, left_join, etc. for each of their respective join types

Note: Please return only one query with each number in a different row

Solution:-
WITH top_ads AS (
	SELECT
		id
	FROM
		ads
	ORDER BY
		id ASC
	LIMIT 3
)
SELECT
	'inner_join' AS join_type,
	count(*) AS number_of_rows
FROM
	ads a
	JOIN top_ads b ON a.id = b.id
UNION ALL
SELECT
	'left_join' AS join_type,
	count(*) AS number_of_rows
FROM
	ads a
	LEFT JOIN top_ads b ON a.id = b.id
UNION ALL
SELECT
	'right_join' AS join_type,
	count(*) AS number_of_rows
FROM
	ads a
	RIGHT JOIN top_ads b ON a.id = b.id
UNION ALL
SELECT
	'cross_join' AS join_type,
	count(*) AS number_of_rows
FROM
	ads a
	CROSS JOIN top_ads b;
