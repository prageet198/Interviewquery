Question:-
Letâ€™s say you work at Uber. The rides table contains information about the trips of Uber users across America

Write a query to get the average commute time (in minutes) for each commuter in New York (NY) and the average commute time (in minutes) across all commuters in New York.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT commuter_id,
 DATE_PART('minute', end_dt - start_dt) AS difference_in_minutes
FROM rides 
WHERE city='NY'
)
SELECT 
DISTINCT commuter_id,
ROUND(AVG(difference_in_minutes) OVER (PARTITION BY commuter_id)) AS avg_commuter_time,
ROUND(AVG(difference_in_minutes) OVER ()) AS avg_time
FROM combineData
