Question:-
We have a table that represents the total number of messages sent between two users by date on messenger.

    What are some insights that could be derived from this table?

    What do you think the distribution of the number of conversations created by each user per day looks like?

    Write a query to get the distribution of the number of conversations created by each user by day in the year 2020.

Solution:-
1. Top-level insights that can be derived from this table are the total number of messages being sent per day, 
number of conversations being started, and the average number of messages per conversation.

If we think about business-facing metrics, we can start analyzing them by including time series.

How many more conversations are being started over the past year compared to now? Do more conversations between two users indicate a closer 
friendship versus the depth of the conversation in total messages? 

2. The distribution would be likely skewed to the right or bimodal. If we think about the probability for a user to have a conversation with more 
than one additional person per day, would that likely be going up or down?

The peak is probably around one to five new conversations a day. After that, we would see a large decrease with a potential 
bump of very active users that may be using messenger tools for work.
WITH dailyConversation AS (
    SELECT user1, DATE(date), COUNT(DISTINCT user2) AS noOfConversion
FROM messages 
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)='2020'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY date
LIMIT 100
)
SELECT noOfConversion, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM dailyConversation
GROUP BY 1
