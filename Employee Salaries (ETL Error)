Question:-
Due to an ETL error, the employees table, instead of updating the salaries every year when doing compensation adjustments, did an insert instead. 
The head of HR still needs the current salary of each employee.

Write a query to get the current salary for each employee.

Note: Assume no duplicate combination of first and last names (I.E. No two John Smiths). Assume the INSERT operation works with ID autoincrement.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT first_name,
last_name,
salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY first_name,last_name
ORDER BY id DESC) AS ranked
FROM employees
)
SELECT first_name,
last_name,
salary
FROM combineData
WHERE ranked='1'
ORDER BY first_name, last_name
