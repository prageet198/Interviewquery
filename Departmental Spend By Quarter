Question:-
Suppose we have a table of transactions happened during 2023, with each transaction belonging to different departments within a company. 
We want to calculate the total spend for IT, HR, and Marketing, and also have a total for Other departments, grouped by fiscal quarters.

Write a query to display this result.

Note: Display only quarters where at least one transaction occurred. Quarter names should be Q1,Q2,Q3 and Q4. Q1 is from January to March.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT * ,
CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) IN (1,2,3) THEN 
'Q1' 
WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) IN (4,5,6) THEN 
'Q2' 
WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) IN (7,8,9) THEN 
'Q3' 
ELSE 'Q4'
END AS quarter
FROM transactions
)
SELECT quarter,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'IT' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS it_spending,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'HR' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS hr_spending,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS marketing_spending,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN department NOT IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Marketing') THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS other_spending
FROM combineData
GROUP BY quarter
ORDER BY quarter
