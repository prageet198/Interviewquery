Question:-
As an accountant for a local grocery store, you have been tasked with calculating the daily sales of each product since their last restocking.

You have been provided with three tables: products, sales, and restocking. The products table contains information about each product, 
the sales table records the sales transactions, and the restocking table tracks the restocking events.

Write a query to retrieve the running total of sales for each product since its last restocking event.

Notes: The sales_since_last_restock column represents the cumulative sales of the product for each day since its last restocking event. 
Order the result set by product_id.

Solution:-
WITH productLastRestokeDate AS(
SELECT product_id, MAX(restock_date) AS lastRestokeDate
FROM restocking
GROUP BY product_id
),
filterData AS (
SELECT sales.product_id,
sales.date AS salesDate,
sales.sold_count,
lastRestokeDate,
CASE WHEN sales.date>=lastRestokeDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
FROM sales INNER JOIN productLastRestokeDate
ON sales.product_id=productLastRestokeDate.product_id
)
SELECT product_name,
salesDate AS date,
SUM(sold_count) OVER(PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY salesDate) AS
sales_since_last_restock
FROM filterData INNER JOIN products
ON filterData.product_id=products.product_id
WHERE flag='1'
ORDER BY products.product_id
