Question:-
You are generating a yearly report for your companyâ€™s revenue sources.

Calculate the percentage of all total revenue made to date that was made during the first and last years recorded in the table. 
Round the percentages to two decimal places.

Solution:-
WITH startingRevenue AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(amount - amount_refunded) AS totalStartingRevenue
    FROM 
        annual_payments
    WHERE 
        status = 'paid' 
        AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = (SELECT MIN(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)) FROM annual_payments)
),
endingRevenue AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(amount - amount_refunded) AS totalEndingRevenue
    FROM 
        annual_payments
    WHERE 
        status = 'paid' 
        AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = (SELECT MAX(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)) FROM annual_payments)
),
overallRevenue AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(amount - amount_refunded) AS totalRevenue
    FROM 
        annual_payments
    WHERE 
        status = 'paid'
)

SELECT 
    ROUND((sr.totalStartingRevenue::numeric / orr.totalRevenue::numeric) * 100.0, 2) AS percent_first,
    ROUND((er.totalEndingRevenue::numeric / orr.totalRevenue::numeric) * 100.0, 2) AS percent_last
FROM 
    overallRevenue orr,
    startingRevenue sr,
    endingRevenue er;
