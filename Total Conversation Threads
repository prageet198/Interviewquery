Question:-
Letâ€™s say you work for Meta. You are given the table messenger_sends. Find the total number of unique conversation threads.

Note: In some entries, the receiver_id and sender_id are switched from the initial message. These entries should be treated as part of the same thread.

Solution:-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 
             CASE WHEN sender_id < receiver_id 
                  THEN CONCAT(sender_id, '_', receiver_id) 
                  ELSE CONCAT(receiver_id, '_', sender_id) 
             END
           ) AS total_conv_threads
FROM messenger_sends ;
