Question:-
Weâ€™re given three tables representing a forum of users and their comments on posts.

Write a query to get the top three users that got the most upvotes on their comments written in 2020. 

Note: Do not count deleted comments and upvotes by users on their own comments

Solution-1:-
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT comments.id AS commentId,
comments.user_id AS commentWrittenBy,
comment_votes.user_id AS upVotedBy,
CASE WHEN comments.user_id!=comment_votes.user_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 
END AS flag
FROM comments INNER JOIN comment_votes 
ON comments.id=comment_votes.comment_id
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM comments.created_at)='2020'
AND is_deleted='false' AND comment_votes.is_upvote='true'
),
calculation AS(
SELECT commentwrittenby,
COUNT(upvotedby) AS totalUpVoted
FROM combineData INNER JOIN users
ON commentwrittenby=users.id
WHERE flag=1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3
)
SELECT commentwrittenby AS id ,users.username,
totalupvoted AS upvotes
FROM calculation INNER JOIN users
ON calculation.commentwrittenby=users.id

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.username,
  SUM(is_upvote) AS upvotes
FROM comments AS c
JOIN comment_votes AS cv
  ON c.id = cv.comment_id
JOIN users AS u
  ON c.user_id = u.id
WHERE YEAR(c.created_at) = 2020
  AND is_deleted = 0
  AND c.user_id != cv.user_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 3
