Question:-
You are tasked to determine which type of notification generates the most conversions. Due to an overlook in the database design, 
there is no concrete way to attribute a purchase to a specific notification. However, you might be able to infer this data.

Given tables notifications, notification_events, and purchases, write a query to determine the conversion rate of each type of notification.

Notes:

    Notifications are perishable, meaning a notification disappears exactly after another one is sent.
    A purchase can only be attributed to a notification once.
    A purchase cannot be attributed to a notification if the product has already been purchased at the time of clicking.
    Order the output by type, alphabetically.

Solution:-
WITH LatestNotifications AS (
    SELECT 
        n.type AS notification_type,
        n.product_id,
        MAX(n.id) AS latest_notification_id
    FROM 
        notifications n
    GROUP BY 
        n.type, n.product_id
),
LatestClickEvents AS (
    SELECT 
        ne.notification_id,
        ne.user_id,
        MAX(ne.clicked_at) AS latest_clicked_at
    FROM 
        notification_events ne
    GROUP BY 
        ne.notification_id, ne.user_id
),
LatestPurchases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        product_id,
        (purchased_at) AS latest_purchased_at
    FROM 
        purchases
)
SELECT 
    ln.notification_type,
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(
            SUM(CASE WHEN lp.latest_purchased_at > lce.latest_clicked_at THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
            NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT lce.notification_id), 0), 0
        ),
        3
    ) AS conversion_rate
FROM 
    LatestNotifications ln
LEFT JOIN LatestClickEvents lce ON ln.latest_notification_id = lce.notification_id
LEFT JOIN notifications n ON lce.notification_id = n.id
LEFT JOIN LatestPurchases lp ON  n.product_id = lp.product_id
GROUP BY 
    ln.notification_type
ORDER BY 
    ln.notification_type;
