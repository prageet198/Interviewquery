Question:-
Let’s say you work at an advertising firm. You have a table of users’ impressions of ad campaigns over time. 
Each impression_id consists of values of user engagement specified by Excited, OK, and Bored.

Write a query to find all users that are currently “Excited” and have never been “Bored” with a campaign.

Solution-1:-
WITH dataCalculation AS (
    SELECT user_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN impression_id='Excited' THEN 1 END) AS excitedCount,
SUM(CASE WHEN impression_id='Bored' THEN 1 END) AS boredCount
FROM ad_impressions
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT user_id
FROM dataCalculation
WHERE excitedCount IS NOT NULL AND boredCount IS NULL
ORDER BY user_id

Solution-2:-
SELECT
    DISTINCT user_id
FROM ad_impressions
WHERE impression_id = 'Excited'
AND user_id NOT IN (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM ad_impressions
    WHERE impression_id = 'Bored'
)
