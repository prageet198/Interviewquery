Question:-
The sms_sends table contains all the messages sent to the users and may contain various message types.

Confirmation messages (type = "confirmation") are sent when a user registers an account and requires a response. 
The system may send multiple confirmation messages to a single phone number, but the user may confirm only the latest one sent to them.

The ds column represents the date when SMSs are sent.

The confirmers table contains phone numbers that responded to confirmation messages and dates when users responded.

Write a query to calculate the number of responses grouped by carrier and country to the SMSs sent by the system on February 28th, 2020.

Solution:-
WITH modify_data AS 
(
  SELECT DATE(ds) sent_date, country,carrier, 
  DATE(LAG(ds) OVER (PARTITION BY phone_number,country,carrier ORDER BY ds DESC)) as next_date,phone_number 
  FROM sms_sends 
  WHERE TYPE = 'confirmation'  
), 
filtered_data AS 
(
  SELECT a.* FROM modify_data a 
  JOIN confirmers b ON a.phone_number = b.phone_number
  WHERE sent_date  ='2020-02-28' and next_date IS NULL
)
SELECT carrier,country, count(*) unique_numbers 
FROM filtered_data GROUP BY country,carrier
