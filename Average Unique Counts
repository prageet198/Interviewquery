Question:-
You have been provided with two tables: user_orders and ordered_items. A user can have multiple orders, and within each order, 
there may be multiple items with either the same or different categories. Find a user that has the highest average number of unique item categories per order.

Note: You may assume that there is only one user with the highest average number of unique item categories per order.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT ordered_items.order_id, 
user_orders.user_name,
COUNT(DISTINCT item_category) AS categoryCount
FROM ordered_items INNER JOIN user_orders 
ON ordered_items.order_id=user_orders.order_id
GROUP BY ordered_items.order_id,user_orders.user_name
ORDER BY ordered_items.order_id
)
SELECT user_name,
AVG(categoryCount) AS avg_unique_item_categories_per_order
FROM combineData
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1
