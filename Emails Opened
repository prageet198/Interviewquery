Question:-
Let’s say you have a table called events that keeps track of every user’s actions. A small example of the events table would look like this:
user_id 	created_at 	action 	platform
1 	2021-01-01 12:00:00 	email_opened 	Android
2 	2021-01-01 12:05:00 	like 	Outlook
3 	2021-01-01 12:10:00 	post_enter 	Gmail
4 	2021-01-01 12:15:00 	post_cancel 	Outlook
5 	2021-01-01 12:20:00 	like 	Gmail

Using this information, you wish to find out how many users have opened an email.

What query would you use to find out?

Solution:-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_users_open_email
FROM events
WHERE action='email_opened'
