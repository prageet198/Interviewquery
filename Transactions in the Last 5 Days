Question:-
Letâ€™s say you work at a bank.

Using the bank_transactions table, find how many users made at least one transaction each day in the first five days of January 2020.

Solution:-
WITH completeData AS (
SELECT user_id,
DATE(created_at) AS transactionDate
FROM bank_transactions
),
previousDate AS(
SELECT user_id,
transactiondate,
LAG(transactiondate,1) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id) AS prevDate
FROM completeData
),
calculation AS (
SELECT * ,
CASE WHEN prevDate IS NULL THEN '1'
ELSE
(transactionDate - prevDate)::int END AS flag
FROM previousDate
),
overallUsers AS(
SELECT user_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalTransactions
FROM calculation
WHERE flag=1 AND transactionDate BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-05'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*)=5
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_users FROM overallUsers
