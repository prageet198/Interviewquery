Question:-
Weâ€™re given three tables representing a forum of users and their comments on posts.

Write a query to get the top three users that got the most upvotes on their comments written in 2020. 

Note: Do not count deleted comments and upvotes by users on their own comments

Solution:-
SELECT
comments.user_id AS id,
users.username,
COUNT(*) AS upvotes
from comments LEFT JOIN comment_votes 
ON comments.id=comment_votes.comment_id AND is_deleted='0'
INNER JOIN users ON users.id=comments.user_id
WHERE YEAR(comments.created_at)='2020' AND is_upvote='1'
GROUP BY comments.user_id, users.username
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 3
