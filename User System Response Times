Question:-
You have been provided with two tables: conversation_messages and interviews.

Write a query to compute the average time it takes for each user to respond to the previous system message. The message type is described in the 
message_type field where it could be either user or system indicating who sent the message.

Solution:-
WITH RankedMessages AS (
    SELECT
    interviews .user_id,
        conversation_messages.message_type,
        conversation_messages.created_at,
        LAG(conversation_messages.created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY interview_id ORDER BY conversation_messages.created_at) AS prev_created_at,
        LAG(conversation_messages.message_type) OVER (PARTITION BY interview_id ORDER BY conversation_messages.created_at) AS prev_message_type
    FROM
        conversation_messages INNER JOIN interviews 
        ON conversation_messages.interview_id=interviews.id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    AVG(
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, prev_created_at, created_at)
    ) AS response_times
FROM
    RankedMessages
WHERE
    message_type = 'user' AND prev_message_type = 'system'
GROUP BY
    user_id
