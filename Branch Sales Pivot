Question:-
Your company, a multinational retail corporation, has been storing sales data from various branches worldwide in separate tables according to 
the year the sales were made. The current data structure is proving inefficient for business analytics and the management has requested your expertise 
to streamline the data.

Write a query to create a pivot table that shows total sales for each branch by year.

Note: Assume that the sales are represented by the total_sales column and are in USD. Each branch is represented by its unique branch_id.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT *, 1 AS flag FROM sales_2021
UNION ALL
SELECT *, 2 AS flag FROM sales_2022
)
SELECT 
    branch_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN flag = 1 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_2021,
    SUM(CASE WHEN flag = 2 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_2022
FROM 
    combineData
GROUP BY 
    branch_id;
