Question:-
Given the employees and departments table, write a query to get the top 3 highest employee salaries by department. 
If the department contains less that 3 employees, the top 2 or the top 1 highest salaries should be listed (assume that each department has at least 1 employee). 

Note: The output should include the full name of the employee in one column, the department name, and the salary. 
The output should be sorted by department name in ascending order and salary in descending order. 

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name) AS employee_name,
salary,
departments.name AS department_name,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranked
from employees INNER JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id=departments.id
)

SELECT department_name,
employee_name,
salary
FROM combineData
WHERE ranked<=3
ORDER BY 1,3 DESC
