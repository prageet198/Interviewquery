Question:-
You have a table containing information about the time that employees have worked on a project.

Write a query to find how many unique calendar days each employee worked. Order your query by the employee_id.

Example:

An employee worked on two projects, and recorded their time like this:
employee_id 	project_id 	start_date 	end_date
1 	1 	2024-01-01 	2024-01-06
1 	2 	2024-01-03 	2024-01-07

Solution:-
-- Assuming PostgreSQL syntax for generate_series function
SELECT
    employee_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT unique_calendar_days) AS unique_days_worked
FROM (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        generate_series(start_date, end_date, interval '1 day')::date AS unique_calendar_days
    FROM
        projects 
) AS dates
GROUP BY
    employee_id
ORDER BY
    employee_id;
	

Solution-2:-
WITH project_dates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        LAG(end_date) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY start_date) AS previous_end_date
    FROM
        projects
),
projectCalculationDate AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        CASE WHEN start_date > previous_end_date OR previous_end_date IS NULL 
        THEN start_date 
        ELSE DATE_ADD(previous_end_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) 
        END AS projectStartDate
    FROM
        project_dates
),
employeeProjectDays AS(
SELECT
    employee_id,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    previous_end_date,
    projectStartDate,
    DATEDIFF(end_date, projectStartDate)+1 AS totalDays
FROM
    projectCalculationDate
)

SELECT employee_id,
SUM(totalDays) AS unique_days_worked
FROM employeeProjectDays
GROUP BY 1
