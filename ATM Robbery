Question:-
There was a robbery from the ATM at the bank where you work. Some unauthorized withdrawals were made, and you need to help your bank 
find out more about those withdrawals.

However, the only information you have is that there was more than 1 withdrawal, they were all performed in 10-second gaps, 
and no legitimate transactions were performed in between two fraudulent withdrawals.

Weâ€™re given a table of bank transactions with three columns, user_id, a deposit or withdrawal value transaction_value, and created_at time for each transaction.

Write a query to retrieve all user IDs in ascending order whose transactions have exactly a 10-second gap from one another.

Note: Assume that there are only withdrawals from the ATM, which are denoted with a positive transaction_value

Solution:-
WITH completeData AS(
    SELECT user_id,
created_at,
LAG(user_id,1) OVER(ORDER BY created_at) AS prevUserId,
LAG(created_at,1) OVER(ORDER BY created_at) AS prevTransaction
FROM bank_transactions ORDER BY created_at
),
calculation AS(
SELECT *,
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (created_at - prevTransaction)) AS diffSec
FROM completeData
)
SELECT DISTINCT(bank_transactions.user_id)
FROM calculation INNER JOIN bank_transactions 
ON calculation.user_id=bank_transactions.user_id OR
calculation.prevuserid=bank_transactions.user_id
WHERE diffSec='10'
