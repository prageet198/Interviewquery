Question:-
As a data analyst in a fitness app company, you are tasked with analyzing the userâ€™s daily step count.

Write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day rolling average of steps for each user, rounded to the nearest whole number.

Notes: The rolling average should only be calculated for days where there are 3 previous days of step counts, including the current day. 
The first 2 days for any user should be excluded.

Solution:-
SELECT t1.user_id,
       t1.date,
       ROUND((t1.steps + t2.steps + t3.steps)/3, 0) AS avg_steps
FROM daily_steps t1
LEFT JOIN daily_steps t2 
	ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
	AND t1.date = date_add(t2.date, interval 1 DAY)
    LEFT JOIN daily_steps t3 
	ON t1.user_id = t3.user_id
	AND t1.date = date_add(t3.date, interval 2 DAY)
    WHERE t2.steps IS NOT NULL
    AND t3.steps IS NOT NULL
