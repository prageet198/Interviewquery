Question:-
Given a table of transactions and products, write a query to return the product id, product price, and average transaction 
total value (price*quantity) of each product such that it has a price higher than the average transaction price.

Notes:

    Round the values to two decimal places.
    The average transaction price is defined as the average amount a customer spends per transaction on a specific product.
    A transaction can only contain one type of product

Solution:-
WITH zap AS (
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(price * quantity), 2) AS avg_price
    FROM transactions AS t
    INNER JOIN products AS p
    	ON t.product_id = p.id
)
SELECT id AS product_id ,price AS product_price, avg_price FROM products
JOIN zap ON 1 = 1
WHERE price > avg_price
