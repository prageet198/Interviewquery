Question:-
The support team at your company is trying to analyze ticketing data to improve response times. They have noticed that a significant number of tickets 
have no assigned agent, making it difficult to track the progress of these tickets.

Write a SQL query to count the total number of tickets, the number of tickets assigned to agents, and the number of tickets that are not assigned to any agent.

Note: Tickets that are not assigned to any agent have NULL in their agent_id field.

Solution:-
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_tickets,
SUM(CASE WHEN agent_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS tickets_with_agent,
SUM(CASE WHEN agent_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS tickets_without_agent
FROM tickets
