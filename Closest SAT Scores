Question:-
Given a table of students and their SAT test scores, write a query to return the two students with the closest test scores with the score difference.

If there are multiple students with the same minimum score difference, select the student name combination that is higher in the alphabet. 

Solution-1:-
WITH initialTable AS (
    SELECT s1.id AS firstId, s1.student AS firstStudent,
s1.score AS firstScore, s2.id AS secondId,
s2.student AS secondStudent, s2.score AS secondScore 
FROM scores AS s1 INNER JOIN scores AS s2
ON s1.id!=s2.id AND s1.id < s2.id
)

SELECT firstStudent AS one_student,
secondStudent AS other_student,
CASE WHEN firstScore<secondScore THEN secondScore-firstScore
ELSE firstScore-secondScore END AS score_diff
FROM initialTable
ORDER BY score_diff, one_student
LIMIT 1

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
    s1.student AS one_student
    , s2.student AS other_student
    , ABS(s1.score - s2.score) AS score_diff
FROM scores AS s1
INNER JOIN scores AS s2
    ON s1.id != s2.id
        AND s1.id < s2.id
ORDER BY 3 ASC, 1 ASC
LIMIT 1
